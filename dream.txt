something here 

That my days have been a dream
Yet if hope has flown away 
In a night or in a day  

All that we see or seem is but
a dream within a dream
Is it therefore gone?  
I stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore

And I hold within my hand  
grains of golden sand
 H
How few yet how they creep through my fingers
as;dlfkjas as;dlfkja
